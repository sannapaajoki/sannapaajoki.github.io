## My personal GitHub website

This is my personal website with a simplified CV and a blog. The content is written in Finnish.

I've used the Jekyll theme Caiman with some minor modifications. The CV uses a responsive [W3.CSS framework](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp). The pages are made with HTML and the blog posts are written with markdown.

My plan is to keep the website fairly simple and to use it in my job search. I'll be writing about my learning experiences on the blog.
